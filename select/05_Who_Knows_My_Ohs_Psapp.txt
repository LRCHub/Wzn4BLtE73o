Take off the years nobody hears as we undue this
Shut, shut my door and wipe my floor, why do we do this?
Cut to the bone more than alone, oh what is meant for us?
Take off the tire we had been due, oh what is meant for us?

Take, take, take your time
Take, take, take your time

Take off the yoke from when we went lee and what is left there
Under the road, a tiny hole, oh what is left there

Take, take, take your time
Take, take, take your time
Take from all of you for true I know that are untrue
Take, take, take your time

Cut to the bone more than alone, oh what is meant for us?
Take off the tire we had been due, oh what is meant for us?

I've taken all that I can
I've taken all that I can
I've taken all that I can
I've taken all that I can
I've taken all that I can
