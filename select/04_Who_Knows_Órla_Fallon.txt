When you look up to follow the stars
Tell me what you see through your eyes
Sailing the sky to search your soul
I see a uni unfold...
We're far apart, you're here in my heart
Home thoughts and fond thoughts surround you
I've sailed the sky and now I know
Yours is the hand I long to hold
Forever, waiting, time will carry me over, always to you
Who knows what we'll ever find?...
Forever, waiting, time will carry me over, always to you
Who knows what we'll ever find?...
A storm in the stars and I'm not afraid
It's never raining through my eyes

I've seen my uni unfold
Forever, waiting, time will carry me over, always to you
Who knows what we'll ever find?...
Forever, waiting, time will carry me over, always to you
Who knows what we'll ever find?...
Who knows what we'll ever find?...
I've seen my uni unfold
Forever, waiting, time will carry me over, always to you
Who knows what we'll ever find?...
Forever, waiting, time will carry me over, always to you
Who knows what we'll ever find?...
